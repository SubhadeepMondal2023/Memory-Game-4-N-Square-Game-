# Memory Game

## Rules

In this game, a deck of cards with 4\*n^2 cards is shuffled and laid out face down in a grid. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time to try to find matching pairs. The goal is to find all the matching pairs in as few turns as possible.

The number of cards in the deck is typically a power of 2 (e.g. 16, 32, 64, etc.), which allows for a symmetrical grid layout and ensures that there are an even number of cards to pair up. The "4\*n^2" formula you mentioned is a way to calculate the number of cards in the deck, where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid. For example, if n=4, the deck would have 4\*4^2 = 64 cards. Here are the rules of the Concentration (or Memory Match) game:

### Number of Players
1 or more

### Deck
A deck of 4\*n^2 cards, where n is a positive integer. Each card has a unique image or symbol on it, and there are exactly two cards with each image.

### Objective
To find all the matching pairs of cards in as few turns as possible.

### Setup
Shuffle the deck and lay out the cards face down in a grid with n rows and n columns.

### Gameplay

1. The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and then play moves clockwise.
2. The first player flips over two cards from the grid to reveal their images.
3. If the two cards match (i.e., they have the same image), the player gets to keep the cards and remove them from the grid.
4. If the two cards do not match, the player flips them back over to their original face-down position.
5. The next player to the left then takes their turn, flipping over two new cards from the grid.
6. Players continue taking turns until all the cards have been matched and removed from the grid.
7. The game is won by the player who finds the most pairs. If there is a tie, the player who found the most pairs in the fewest number of turns wins.

### Optional Rules

- Some versions of the game allow players to "peek" at a card before flipping it over, to get a glimpse of the image on the other side.
- Some versions of the game use a "memory" mechanism, where players can choose to "remember" a card they have previously flipped over, allowing them to recall its image later in the game.
- Some versions of the game use a timer, and players must find as many pairs as possible within a set time limit.

### Strategies

- Try to remember the location of cards you have previously flipped over, to increase your chances of finding a match.
- Use a systematic approach to searching the grid, such as starting from one corner and working your way across.
- Try to eliminate possibilities by process of elimination, such as if you know a card is not in a certain location, you can rule out that location for future searches.
